          <h3>Minecraft developers won’t allow NFTs on gaming platform</h3>
          <p>
            Minecraft will not allow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to be used on
            the popular gaming platform, with the company describing them as
            antithetical to Minecraft’s “values of creative inclusion and
            playing together”. NFTs confer ownership of a unique digital item,
            typically an image or a video, with the ownership recorded on a
            decentralised digital register known as a blockchain. Digital files
            can usually be copied or deleted for free, but a NFT identifies the
            owner of the original file for the purposes of buying, selling, or
            trading the ownership – usually for cryptocurrency. The hype around
            NFTs led to a boom in sales peaking at US$12bn (AU$17.4bn) worldwide
            in January. However, coinciding with the downturn in cryptocurrency,
            sales recently began crashing to a 12-month low of US$1bn
            (AU$1.45bn) in June.
            <br />
            <br />
            Minecraft, which allows users to build whole virtual worlds, is
            highly customisable. Over the more than 10 years the game has
            existed it has built a huge community of users who design skins,
            mods and maps for the game. Minecraft represented an attractive
            potential market for NFTs, with a user base – estimated at more than
            141 million by August 2021 – already engaged in sharing unique
            digital items developed for the game. But the Microsoft-owned
            development studio behind Minecraft, Mojang, has put an end to
            speculation NFTs could be allowed in the game. In a blog post on
            Wednesday, the developers said blockchain technology was not
            permitted, stating it was antithetical to Minecraft’s values. “Each
            of these uses of NFTs and other blockchain technologies creates
            digital ownership based on scarcity and exclusion, which does not
            align with Minecraft values of creative inclusion and playing
            together,” the company said.
            <br /><br />
            “NFTs are not inclusive of all our community and create a scenario
            of the haves and the have-nots. The speculative pricing and
            investment mentality around NFTs takes the focus away from playing
            the game and encourages profiteering, which we think is inconsistent
            with the long-term joy and success of our players.” Mojang said the
            creations in Minecraft had intrinsic value and there had been
            instances where NFTs were sold at artificially or fraudulently
            inflated prices. The studio said it was concerned third-party NFTs
            may not be reliable and could end up costing players. It also said
            it was worried an implementation of Minecraft built entirely on
            blockchain technology could also disappear without notice – meaning
            players would have lost their investments.
            <br /><br />
            This is referred to in the crypto community as a “rug pull”, where
            the developers behind a crypto project shut down the project and
            take off with the money. This appears to have already happened with
            one third-party Minecraft project called Blockverse. PC Gamer
            reported in January the project disappeared after over US$1m
            (AU$1.45m) had been invested. Mojang left the door open to using
            “more secure” blockchain technology in Minecraft in the future but
            said it had no plans to allow it at present. ne group that was
            working on building NFTs into Minecraft said the move was a “step
            backwards in innovation” and if they were banned they would need to
            pivot to another gaming platform. Another wildly popular and
            similarly customisable game, Roblox, which allows for in-game
            purchases of items, has not yet announced a position on NFTs.
            However, the company’s chief business officer, Craig Donato, told
            VentureBeat in April he didn’t see why the game would not allow NFTs
            and it was more a question of when. Other gaming companies like
            Square Enix and Ubisoft are also toying with NFTs. This week Square
            Enix announced that for the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy VII
            next year people would be able to get physical trading cards with
            digital versions as NFTs.
