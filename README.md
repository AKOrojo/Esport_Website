# Front_End_Web_Website_Assignment
Your brief is to design and build a responsive website to cater for an online community. This may take the form of a hobbyist website or a social or political group.

The community can be fictional or real. It’s fine to build something for future use by a group you are a member of. Examples might include:

Advice and news for people who keep snakes
A website highlighting library closures and organisations fighting against them.
A site where climbers discuss climbing walls and equipment shops
Deadline: 4pm on 1 August
