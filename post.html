            Dummy text refers to the bits of content that are used to fill a
            website mock-up. This text helps web designers better envision how
            the website will look as a finished product. It is important to
            understand that dummy text has no meaning whatsoever. Its sole
            purpose is to fill out blank spaces with “word-like” content,
            without making any copyright infringements.
